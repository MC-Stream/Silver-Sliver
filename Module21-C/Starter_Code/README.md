# Kasei Coin

The Martian Aerospace Agency wants to be part of the first human colony on Mars. They want to develop a monetary system for the new Mars colony. They have decided to base this new monetary system on blockchain technology, and to define a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin. (“Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. A crowdsale will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
