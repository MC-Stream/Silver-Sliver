# PyChain Decentralized Ledger

For the company, this is a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger allows partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to allows the company to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

All three methods will be evaluated and reported upon in an accompanying report (EvaluationReport.md).
