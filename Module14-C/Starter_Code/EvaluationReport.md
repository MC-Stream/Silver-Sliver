8. Write your conclusions about the performance of the baseline trading algorithm in the `README.md` file thatâ€™s associated with your GitHub repository. Support your findings by using the PNG image that you saved in the previous step.

2. Tune the trading algorithm by adjusting the SMA input features. Adjust one or both of the windows for the algorithm. Rerun the notebook with the updated parameters, and record the results in your `README.md` file. Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?

3. Choose the set of parameters that best improved the trading algorithm returns. Save a PNG image of the cumulative product of the actual returns vs. the strategy returns, and document your conclusion in your `README.md` file.

3. Backtest the new model to evaluate its performance. Save a PNG image of the cumulative product of the actual returns vs. the strategy returns for this updated trading algorithm, and write your conclusions in your `README.md` file. Answer the following questions: Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model? Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm?

In the previous sections, you updated your `README.md` file with your conclusions. To accomplish this section, you need to add a summary evaluation report at the end of the `README.md` file. For this report, express your final conclusions and analysis. Support your findings by using the PNG images that you created.
